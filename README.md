Documentation for making Muka Cords
## Harvesting
The tikanga and protocols around harvesting flax are very interesting and largely ingrained into respect for the earth and plant and thanking it for being of resource to us which really is a beautiful thing.

 The shoots of the harakeke grow in families with the child growing in the middle, when harvesting flax we cut from the grandparents on the outside to respect the plants and not interfere with the families growth.  Making sure to cut on an angle so the rain doesnâ€™t collect in the centre and rot the plant. We also try take evenly from the bush where possible (i.e. not all on one side, or just from one side if the bush is fuller on one side than the other) and try to leave the plant looking happier than we found it (cleaning up any dead leaves).
We said thanks to the plant and tied up the harakeke we harvested with a strand of the harakeke that was stripped from one of the pieces we harvested and made our way bac to the studio to harvest the Muka from the harakeke.
## Processing

You will need:
